// Implementations of min() and max() mathematical operations, similar to std::min() and std::max().
//
// The reason this is necessary is because std::min()/std::max() generate really poor code on
// Visual Studio. The below implementation seem to generate exactly the assembly we want (i.e.
// the minss/maxss x86 instructions for T=float) on Visual Studio 2019. They also seem to generate
// equally good code to std::min()/std::max() on Clang.
//
// See my tweet about it for experiments: https://twitter.com/PetorSFZ/status/1165330439269167104
//
// Pre-emptive FAQ:
// * Why name them sfzMin/sfzMax instead of sfz::min() and sfz::max()?
//    Two reasons:
//      1. Avoiding any ambiguity regarding whether sfzMin() or std::min() is used.
//      2. min/max are annoying names because they are often defined by windows.h, causing
//         trouble when you least expect.
// * Why not place them in namespace sfz like all the other sfzCore code?
//    Since we have prefixed their names with sfz there is literaly no point to also placing them
//    inside the sfz namespace. sfz::sfzMin() just looks stupid.
